${pluginName} Token Procedure Plugin
=============================================

A custom Token Procedure plugin for the Curity Identity Server.

Building the Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can build the plugin by issuing the command ``mvn package``. This will produce a JAR file in the ``target`` directory,
which can be installed.

Installing the Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the plugin, copy the compiled JAR (and all of its dependencies) into the :file:`${IDSVR_HOME}/usr/share/plugins/${pluginName}`
on each node, including the admin node. For more information about installing plugins, refer to the `curity.io/plugins`_.

Required Dependencies
"""""""""""""""""""""

For a list of the dependencies and their versions, run ``mvn dependency:list``. Ensure that all of these are installed in
the plugin group; otherwise, they will not be accessible to this plug-in and run-time errors will result.
